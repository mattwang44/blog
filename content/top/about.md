I'm Wei-Hsiang (Matt) Wang, from Taiwan.

I'm a software engineer at [Umbo Computer Vision](https://umbocv.ai) focusing primarily on the development of [realtime human detection pipeline](https://umbocv.ai/umbo_light) in Python & Node.js. I received both of my B.S. (2016) & M.S. (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/). Also a cat slave to a tabby named `Mujo` & a calico named `Muya`.
