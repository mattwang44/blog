I'm currently a Backend Engineer at [GoFreight](https://gofreight.com) architecting the API gateway service and contructing the cargo tracking system for our core freight management product. I was previously a Backend/DevOps Engineer at [Umbo Computer Vision](https://umbocv.ai) focusing primarily on the development of [realtime human/vehicle detection pipeline](https://umbocv.ai/umbo_light).

I'm also a volunteer in Taiwanese Python community. In 2021 & 2022, I was the lead of web team in PyCon Taiwan and led a 10-people team maintaining [the website](https://pycon.tw) & proposal-submitting system in Django & Vue.js on GCP. I joined [Python document translation project (zh_TW)](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw) as a coordinator and help boosting the translation progress from 2% to 20% so far.

Before that, I was pursuing both of my B.S. (2016) & M.S. (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I conducted the research in mechanism design & patent analysis.

Also a cat slave to a tabby named `Mujo` & a calico named `Muya`.
