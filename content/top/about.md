# About

<!-- ![](/img/avatar.jpg#avatar) -->

I'm Wei-Hsiang (Matt) Wang from Taiwan.

I'm currently seeking for a new position as a backend engineer. Checkout my [resume](https://mattwang44.github.io/resume/main.pdf) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wei-hsiang-wang-60841b108/) and feel free to reach me.

I was previously a Backend Engineer at [Umbo Computer Vision](https://umbocv.ai) focusing primarily on the development of [realtime human/vehicle detection pipeline](https://umbocv.ai/umbo_light) mainly in Python & Node.js with AWS.

I'm also a volunteer in Taiwanese Python community. In 2021, I was the lead of web team in PyCon Taiwan and led a 10-people team maintaining [the website](https://pycon.tw/2021) & proposal-submitting system in Django & Vue.js on GCP. I recently became the coordinator of the [Python document translation project (zh_TW)](https://github.com/python/python-docs-zh-tw) and led the translation progress from 2% to 10% so far.

Before my career started, I was pursuing both of my B.S. (2016) & M.S. (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I conducted the research in mechanism design & patent analysis.

Also a cat slave to a tabby named `Mujo` & a calico named `Muya`.
