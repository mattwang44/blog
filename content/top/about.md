![](/img/avatar.gif#avatar)

I'm Wei-Hsiang (Matt) Wang from Taiwan. I'm currently a Backend Engineer at [Umbo Computer Vision](https://umbocv.ai) focusing primarily on the development of [realtime detection pipeline](https://umbocv.ai/umbo_light) in Python & Node.js. I'm also a volunteer developer in PyCon TW and lead a 10-people team establishing the [website](https://pycon.tw/2021) of PyCon TW 2021 Conference in Django & Vue.js.

Before working in UmboCV, I received both of my B.S. (2016) & M.S. (2018) in Mechanical Engineering from [National Taiwan University (NTU)](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), where I conducted the research in mechanism design & patent analysis.

Also a cat slave to a tabby named `Mujo` & a calico named `Muya`.
